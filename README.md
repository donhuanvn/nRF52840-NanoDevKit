# nRF52840-NanoDevKit

hardware design of nRF52840 Nano Development Kit
nRF52840 nano development kit is a customzied development kit of Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 SoC.
The key futures of nano development kit are:

- GT840A_01 module.
- Buttons, Leds have I/Os same as nrf52840 DK of Nordic Semi.
- MCU UART header.
- MCU USB interface with Micro-USB connector.
- SWD interface with Debug header.
- GPIO/Power headers that are arranged for compatibility with common sensor modules at hshop.vn .
- CR2032 battery power.

All components of this design that can be found at electronic stores in Vietnam. The module of nRF52840 (GT840A_01) is an exception :D. You can refer to file Production/Components_And_Links.xlsx for buying these components.
